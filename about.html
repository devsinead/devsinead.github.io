        <h2 align=center> Hello my name is Sinead!</h2>
        
        <p style="text-align: center">
            I am a university student studying media and communications and minoring in information technologies. My passion is studying the intersection of technology and the arts. Iâ€™ve worked within my community to provide equal access to technology for students and designed multimedia projects. Working within my campus community has helped me break out of my anxiety as well as helped me challenge myself. while pursuing new experiences I hope to make a greater impact on my local community and gain new connections by working within passionate work teams.
